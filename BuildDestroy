This one is cribbed from the Five Percent Nation of Islam. 

I'm most interested in the significance of the numeral '8' in this system, but am incorporating/hijacking their code as reference.

"Five Percenters also depart from NOI in their teaching of the Supreme Alphabet and Supreme Mathematics, an arcane system devised by Clarence 13X wherein each letter or numeral denotes a concept with an accompanying parable. "A" stands for Allah, "B" is Be or Born, "C" is See and so on. This process is known as "dropping science".

Supreme Mathematics - teaches that numbers 0-9 means:
1 - Knowledge
2 - Wisdom
3 - Understanding
4 - Culture/Freedom
5 - Power/Refinement
6 - Equality
7 - God
8 - Build/Destroy
9 - Born
0 - Cipher"

*Could also be something like "Cut/Join" or "Fuse/Dismember" - maybe alchemical references would be appropriate here.

Also potentially appropriate:
